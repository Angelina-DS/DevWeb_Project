# DevWeb_Project

## Introduction

As part of our third and last year in engineering school at ENSAI we had to carry out a project in groups of 3 or 4 for the ***Developpement Web*** course.
Thereof consisted in elaborating a web application for the management of clients' and doctors' appointments in a medical practice (with an undefined number of clients, and with 3 doctors). We thus have created this application to make it easy for customers to manage or book their appointments via the Internet and thanks to several customizable options. The application will also be accessible by the secretary of the medical practice and the doctors all have the role of administrator.

## Installing the requirements and running the application

In order to be able to run the application, one will have to install the following recent distributions/versions of php and mysql **(-> TODO : tell exactly what versions)**.
